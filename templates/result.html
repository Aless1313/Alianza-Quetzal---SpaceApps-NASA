                        Wash your hands frequently<br>
                        Wash your hands often with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or soap and water.<br>
                        <br>
                        Why? Washing your hands with an alcohol-based disinfectant or soap and water kills the virus if it is on your hands.<br>
                        <br>
                        Take respiratory hygiene measures<br>
                        When coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with your elbow flexed or with a tissue. Throw the tissue away immediately and wash your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or soap and water.<br>
                        <br>
                        Why? Covering the mouth and nose during a cough or sneeze prevents the spread of germs and viruses. If you sneeze or cough with your hands, you can contaminate the objects or people you touch.<br>
                        <br>
                        Maintain social distance<br>
                        Keep at least 1 meter (3 feet) away from yourself and others, particularly those who cough, sneeze, and have a fever.<br>
                        <br>
                        Why? When someone with a respiratory illness, such as a 2019-nCoV infection, coughs or sneezes, they project small droplets that contain the virus. If it is too close, you can inhale the virus.
